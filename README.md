The project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis model to classify text data into sentiment categories. Various machine learning and deep learning models were tested, including LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and transformer-based models like RoBERTa and ALBERT. The study identifies
RoBERTa as the most accurate model for multi-class sentiment analysis, achieving an accuracy of 91.8%.
